To run a **Spring Boot** application from **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Install Required Extensions**
Install the following VS Code extensions to support Spring Boot development:
1. **Extension Pack for Java**:
   - Includes essential tools for Java development.
2. **Spring Boot Extension Pack**:
   - Includes extensions for Spring Boot, Spring Initializr, and Spring Boot Dashboard.
   - Install it from the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
---

### **2. Open the Spring Boot Project**
1. Open your Spring Boot project in VS Code:
   - Go to **File > Open Folder** and select the folder containing your Spring Boot project.
2. Ensure the project has a `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle) file.

---

### **3. Build the Project**
1. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+`` or `Cmd+`` on macOS).
2. Run the following command to build the project:
   - For Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```
   - For Gradle:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew build
     ```

This ensures that the project compiles successfully and all dependencies are downloaded.

---

### **4. Run the Spring Boot Application**
There are two ways to run the application:

#### **Option 1: Using the Spring Boot Dashboard**
1. Open the **Spring Boot Dashboard**:
   - Go to the Activity Bar on the left and click the Spring Boot icon.
2. Locate your Spring Boot application in the dashboard.
3. Click the **Run** button next to your application.

#### **Option 2: Using the Terminal**
1. Run the application directly from the terminal:
   - For Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```
   - For Gradle:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew bootRun
     ```

---

### **5. Debug the Spring Boot Application**
To debug the application:
1. Open the `Run and Debug` view (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on macOS).
2. Click **"Create a launch.json file"** if it doesn't already exist.
3. Select **Java** as the environment.
4. Add the following configuration to `launch.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "java",
     "request": "launch",
     "name": "Debug Spring Boot",
     "mainClass": "com.example.Application", // Replace with your main class
     "projectName": "your-project-name"
   }
   ```
5. Start the debugger by clicking the green **Run** button in the `Run and Debug` view.

---

### **6. Access the Application**
Once the application is running, access it in your browser at:
```plaintext
http://localhost:8080
```
Replace `8080` with the port configured in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file if it's different.

---

### **7. Monitor Logs**
You can view the application logs in the integrated terminal or the Spring Boot Dashboard.

---

### Summary
- Install the **Spring Boot Extension Pack** and **Debugger for Java** in VS Code.
- Build the project using Maven or Gradle.
- Run the application using the Spring Boot Dashboard or terminal commands.
- Debug the application using the `Run and Debug` view.

This setup allows you to efficiently develop, run, and debug Spring Boot applications in VS Code.
